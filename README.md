### Object-Oriented Mechanisms Identification

In this repository, you can find the source code to the simple application which detects object-oriented mechanisms from Java source code. Simply input the folder path to your root Java project directory, hit the "Run" button, and enjoy the outputs you are provided with.
To get the Python script to run, you'll need to keep all the other 3 files from this repository in a single folder, and install the following libraries:
- pip install anytree
- pip install tk

Optionally, if you want to export the app as an executable file:
- pip install pyinstaller
- pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "Logo.png;." --add-data "appIcon.ico;." --icon="appIcon.ico" "OOP Identification.pyw"
